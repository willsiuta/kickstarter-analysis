## Overview of Project

The project takes an in-depth look at data for fundraising campaigns for various plays looking at various factors such as launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare Louise's play to other plays in terms of fundraising goals
## Analysis and Challenges
Some of the challenges that we encountered were determining which factors to look at and determining how to visualize such results.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

There seems to be a peak in the graph towards the Summer months, specifically June, in which months the play was more likely to be successfully funded
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the chart in the file, it seems there is a trend that the loftier the initial fundraising goal, the less likely the goal would be achieved.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were difficulties visualizing the data in a concise way and recognizing patterns.  Also, we really only proved correlation as opposed to causation.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The plays that had Summer launch dates had more success on a percentage basis, and it seems that the ones which failed seemed to stay relatively flat with regards to the Launch month.   
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The plays that had loftier goals had less success on a percentage basis.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 Some limitations are that we don't know whether there are other confounding variables/ whether this is correlation vs. causation
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    We could create a chart comparing the average fundraising goal vs the actual amount raised as opposed to the % successful based on fundraising goal.
